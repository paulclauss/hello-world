Tutorial/Guide Repository

Hello, all!

This repository was simply for me to get familiar (again) with GitHub! Right now, I'm just going through the motions of the tutorial (i.e. creating repositories, branches, committing changes, finalizing pull requests, etc.) Other than that, my name is Paul. I like to do relatively anything outside whether that be paddleboarding, hiking, swimming, or just anything in nature. When I'm not doing that, however, I'm either solving puzzles (physical or digital), or I'm playing video games. :)
